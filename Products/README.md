# Products

This repository contains a very small product management system that allows users to add and save products to a file, and also load and display them from the same file. The system is written in C++ and uses the Product and Controller classes.

## Dependencies

The system depends on the following files:

- `main.cpp`
- `Product.h`
- `Product.cpp`
- `Controller.h`
- `Controller.cpp`
- `overloads.h`

## Example of execute

```
Name of Product: milk
Price: 1.43
Name of Product: bread
Price: 1.65
Name of Product: lemonade
Price: 1.8

The data loaded from the file: 
milk 1.4
bread 1.6
lemonade 1.8

Thank you
