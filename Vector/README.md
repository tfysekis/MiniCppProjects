# Vector Operations in C++

This C++ program performs various operations on a vector, including calculating its magnitude, angle, multiplication, and cloning.

## Input

The user inputs the coordinates of the vector as three floating-point numbers separated by spaces. For example:

```
1 2 3 
```

## Output

The program performs the following operations on the input vector:

- Magnitude: Calculates the magnitude of the vector and outputs it as a floating-point number.

- Angle: Calculates the angle between the vector and the x-axis (in degrees) and outputs it as a floating-point number.

- Multiplication: Multiplies the vector by a scalar input by the user and outputs the 
resulting vector.

- Clone: Creates a new vector that is a clone of the input vector and outputs its coordinates.
