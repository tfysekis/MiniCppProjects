# C++ Small Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of small C++ projects that I've worked on. Each project is contained in its own folder and includes a brief description and instructions for running the code.

## Projects So Far

- `Classes and Objects(Trianlge)`: A program that demonstrates the total basics.
- `Vector`: A program that calculates the magnitude,angle,multiply,clone(..) of a vector.
- `Scooter` : A program that demonstrates the inheritance in c++

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, simply navigate to the project folder and run the corresponding executable file. Each project folder also includes a `README.md` file with more detailed instructions and information about the project.
