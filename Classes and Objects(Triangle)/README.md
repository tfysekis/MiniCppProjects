# Finding Base, Height, Area, and Triangle Type in C++

This C++ program calculates the base, height, and area of a triangle, and also classifies the triangle based on its angles. The user inputs the three sides of the triangle, and the program outputs the base, height, area, and triangle type.

## Input Example

The program expects the user to input the three sides of the triangle. Here's an example input:

```
0 0 -5 1 6 1
```


The program will then output the following:

```
Sides: 5.1, 6.1, 11
Angles: a= 159.2 b= 11.3, c= 9.5
Scalino
Amvligonio
Height: 2.2 Base: 5.1 Area: 5.5
```

In this example, the program calculates the perimeter and angles of the triangle, and determines that it is a scalene (i.e., all sides are different lengths), amblygonal (i.e., one angle is obtuse) triangle. It then calculates the height, base, and area of the triangle and outputs the results.
